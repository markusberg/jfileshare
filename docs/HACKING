JFileShare developer's documentation

Setting up your development environment:
* install tomcat5.5, ant, mysql
* install the tomcat5-admin webapps
* install the mysql connector
* Create a build.properties file in your homedir or your buildroot. It should
look something like this:
catalina.home=${user.home}/apache-tomcat-5.5.28
catalina-ant.jar=${catalina.home}/server/lib/[catalina-ant5].jar

manager.username=myusername
manager.password=mypassword

manager.url=http://localhost:8080/manager


Netbeans environment:
If you want to use the Netbeans IDE, you should follow these simple steps
* Install netbeans
* Setup a local tomcat 5.5 installation and configure netbeans to use it
* Import the existing sources (including the build.xml ant-file) into a new netbeans project
* Netbeans is a nice IDE to work with
