* install the mysql connector in the ${TOMCAT_HOME}/lib directory
* The following packages are included in the source distribution:
  + jakarta-commons-io
  + classpathx-mail
  + commons-fileupload
  + sitemesh

* Create a build.properties file in your homedir or your buildroot. It should
look something like this:
catalina.home=${user.home}/apache-tomcat-7.0.30

manager.username=myusername
manager.password=mypassword

manager.url=http://localhost:8080/manager
EOF

FIXME: When using a /file/download link and the file is password protected, non-7bit-ascii characters are not handled correctly. Fix this by adjusting the characterencoding and fileauthentication filters
