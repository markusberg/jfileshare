JFileShare developer's documentation

Setting up your development environment:
* install openjdk, ant, mysql
* download tomcat6 and unzip in your homedir
* install the mysql connector in the ${TOMCAT_HOME}/lib directory
* Create a build.properties file in your homedir or your buildroot. It should
look something like this:
catalina.home=${user.home}/apache-tomcat-6.0.29

manager.username=myusername
manager.password=mypassword

manager.url=http://localhost:8080/manager
EOF

If you want to use the Netbeans IDE, you should follow these simple steps
* Install netbeans
* Setup a local tomcat 6 installation and configure netbeans to use it
* Import the existing sources (including the build.xml ant-file) into a new netbeans project
* Netbeans is a nice IDE to work with
